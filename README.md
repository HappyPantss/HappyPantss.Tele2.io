This was my final assignment for Front-End Development, a subject I had in my second year of my study Communication and Multimedia Design at the Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences. The assignment was to copy a known website and change some things. We had to use JavaScript for this. The website I copied is https://www.tele2.nl/.
